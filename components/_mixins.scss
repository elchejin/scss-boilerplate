// mixings
// in this file you will put all mixing functions.
// comment after every mixin, in your comments you must explain what it does, which values gets and what does it generate.

// Mixin for background image that needs no-repeat property, to use it you need to specify name of the image with extension (image.jpg) size of the image
//(in some cases like retina display you'll need a 2x size image and specify 1x size on css), and align (center center, or right center, center top etc.)

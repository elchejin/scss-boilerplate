// In this file you will put some quick bug fixes that you will integrate properly in the future in the scss structure, but for now you need to do some tests
// or if you need to make a fix, override or some css techniques that you feel shame of, you must comment every fix properly so anyone can understand why you did it

/**
 * Nav specificity fix.
 *
 * Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a {}`) which trumps the
 * nav selectors (`.site-nav a {}`). Use !important to override it until I
 * have time to refactor the header stuff.
